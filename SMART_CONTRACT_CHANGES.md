# Smart Contract Changes History

Based on the commit history and diff analysis, here are the key smart contract changes that were made:

## Smart Contract Adjustments Summary

### 1. **Penalties and Boost APY Logic Removal** (Commit: 3bd4453)

**Removed Features:**
- **Penalty System**: Complete removal of early termination penalties
  - Deleted `calculateEarlyTerminationPenalty()` function
  - Removed `terminateStream()` functionality 
  - Eliminated `getPenaltyInfo()` function
  - Removed penalty-related events and struct fields

- **Boost APY System**: Complete removal of yield/boost mechanics
  - Deleted `boostAPR`, `totalBoostEarned`, `claimedBoostAmount` from `StreamFinancials` struct
  - Removed `claimStreamWithBoost()` and `claimBoostOnly()` functions
  - Eliminated `getBoostEarnings()` and `getClaimableBoostAmount()` functions
  - Deleted boost-related events and asset yield configurations

**Simplified Structure:**
```solidity
// Before (complex)
struct StreamFinancials {
    uint256 totalAmount;
    uint256 claimedAmount;
    bool boosted;
    uint256 boostAPR;
    uint256 penaltiesAccrued;
    uint256 totalBoostEarned;
    uint256 claimedBoostAmount;
}

// After (simplified) 
struct StreamFinancials {
    uint256 totalAmount;
    uint256 claimedAmount;
}
```

### 2. **Asset Configuration Simplification**
- Removed `yieldBoostBaseAPR` and `volatilityScore` from `AssetState` struct
- Simplified `setMockAssetData()` to only handle basic asset properties (symbol, price, decimals)

### 3. **Function Parameter Reduction**
- `createStream()` function simplified by removing `_boosted` parameter
- Stream creation now focuses purely on linear vesting without boost complications

### 4. **Cliff System Refinement**
- Maintained robust cliff vesting functionality
- Simplified `canClaimDuringCliff()` to return only principal claiming status
- Preserved comprehensive cliff validation and progress tracking

### 5. **Mock Function Cleanup**
- Removed boost-related mock functions (`mockUpdateStreamBoostAPR`, `mockApplyPenalty`)
- Kept essential testing functions for stream lifecycle simulation

### 6. **Template Contract Removal** (Commit: 478394d)
- Deleted default Forge template files (`Contract.sol`, `Contract.t.sol`)
- Cleaned up boilerplate code

### 7. **Address Checksum Fixes** (Commit: 03e36b1)
- Fixed address checksum issues in deployment scripts
- Updated `CreateTwoStreams.s.sol` and `DeploySimple.s.sol`

### 8. **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure** (Commit: 91c0d6c)
- Added `CreateEndedStream.s.sol` script for testing stream completion scenarios
- Implemented mock timestamp functionality for time-based testing

## Impact Analysis

**Simplified Architecture:**
- Reduced from complex yield-generating system to clean linear vesting protocol
- Eliminated penalty-based early termination in favor of natural completion model
- Maintained cliff vesting as core differentiating feature

**Improved Maintainability:**
- Removed ~500 lines of complex boost/penalty logic
- Cleaner state management with simplified structs
- Reduced attack surface and potential edge cases

**Enhanced Focus:**
- Protocol now specializes in **linear vesting with cliff periods**
- Clear sender-recipient relationship model
- Predictable token release without yield complications

## Key Commits

| Commit | Description | Files Changed |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 91c0d6c | feat: add CreateEndedStream script with mock timestamp functionality | script/CreateEndedStream.s.sol + deployment files |
| 03e36b1 | fix: correct address checksum in CreateTwoStreams script | script/CreateTwoStreams.s.sol, script/DeploySimple.s.sol |
| 478394d | delete the forge template contract | src/Contract.sol, test/Contract.t.sol |
| 3bd4453 | delete penalties and boost APY logic | src/StreamBoost.sol, test/StreamBoost.t.sol, design-draft.md |

## Transformation Summary

These changes transformed the protocol from a complex yield-generating streaming system into a focused, reliable linear vesting platform with optional cliff periods - aligning with the simplified design documented in `design-draft.md`.

**Core Features Retained:**
- Linear vesting mechanics
- Cliff period functionality  
- Pause/resume controls
- Comprehensive validation
- Mock testing infrastructure

**Complex Features Removed:**
- Yield/boost APY calculations
- Early termination penalties
- Multi-modal claiming strategies
- Volatility-based asset scoring
- Penalty accrual tracking
