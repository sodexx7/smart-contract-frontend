## 1. Main goal

This project aims for creating front-end integrating with smart contracts by using AI(claude). For my own purpose, Firstly, is to create front-end efficiently by leverage AI abilites, to be specific, not only increasing the front-end development speed but also delegating so many works to AI, for example, some stuff that will spend me so much time to familiar or some work I am resent to do. Secondly, is the preparation for future usage, such as a hackathon project or other projects needing the front-end, which can helpe me save the time in developing front-end or do some works I havn't the abilites to implement. Thirdly, is the practice by using AI. Or aware the AI's limitations, make sense how to use it effiectively under the limitations.

Initially, I haven't the business logic for this project, however, from the front-end prospective that there exists some commond logics. Some of my thoughts as below.

1. Reading logic: read data from smart contracts.
2. Writing some data to the smart contracts.
3. Complex data showing: such as the list of some type data.
4. Showing the workflow logic: As this project shows that is the steps how to create one stream. Of course, the workflow logic is tightly integrated with the business logic, so this would be varies in differetn business logic. As in this project, the main goal just show the workflow.
5. Other components such as intergrating with traditional back-end, for this project, showing the blockchain's status by connecting the RPC.

## 2. Process

### 2.1 business logic confirm

Firstly, I didn't have a clear business model, just want to implement the front-end as above. So ask AI to supply one business model satisfly above requirements. After multiply conversations with different AI, Finally, I decided pick up [design-draft](design-draft.md). Of course, the draft was refactored many times, such as deleted the penalities or boost APY logic, whose logic AI doesn't implement in an appropriately way.

### 2.2 draft the front-end

Return to the core task, based on current business model and the data structure, then apply the figama to create the first dradt model. So based on the [design-draft](design-draft.md), Ask AI to supply the front-end desgin suggesitons [figma-design-concept](figma-design-concept.md). Then based on this Apply figma creating the front-end.
draft figma code:
[draft figma code](https://www.figma.com/make/QDPHHU04yXYiwjSxBL7gg0/Dashboard-Layout-Design?node-id=0-4&t=Rd0jeIwtrvzGD3uF-1), from this front-end effctives, the layout, theme, basic data structure display had staisfied my requirements.

### 2.3 Iterations, make the basic features work

Now, it's time to get the figma code, which can be the beginning for the front-end code. Claude will check the related technical stack, then make it work trough some conversations.
Some iterated list chekc below, Obviously, to make it work as expected needing so many prompts.

1. Stream Detail Modal Fixes (Latest - c538e0c)

- UI Logic Improvements: Removed claim button from outgoing streams (senders can't claim their own tokens)
- Label Updates: Changed "Claimed" â†’ "Claimed by recipient", "Claimable" â†’ "Available to claim" for sender view
- Feature Removal: Removed ðŸš€ BOOST DETAILS section and Stream History button for cleaner UX
- New Feature: Added "View Sender" functionality linking to chain explorers (Etherscan, Sepolia, Basescan)
- Data Accuracy: Fixed stream data display using correct properties (progress, streamAmount, claimedAmount)

2. Dynamic Token Integration (19cd18a)

- Real-time Balances: Replaced hardcoded tokens with dynamic balance fetching from Sepolia contracts
- Smart Filtering: Only show tokens with â‰¥1000 unit minimum balance
- Wallet Integration: Connected wallet status to token selection dropdown
- UI Simplification: Removed yield boost functionality, restored cliff options, removed preview panel from step 1
- Contract Integration: Updated token addresses to match deployed contracts (USDC, WETH, USDT, BTC)

3. Owner Dashboard Enhancement (8acf315)

- Admin Functionality: Contract owner can view ALL platform streams
- Visual Distinctions:
  - Green border: Owner's streams
  - Purple border: Third-party streams
  - Special badges: "Your Stream", "Third Party", "Owner View"
- Enhanced Filtering: Improved stream visibility logic for owner vs regular users

4. Infrastructure & Security (012741c)

- Security: Replaced sensitive Alchemy API keys with public RPC endpoints
- Network Persistence: Added wallet network persistence across page refreshes
- Stream Direction: Fixed filtering based on connected wallet address
- UI Improvements: Enhanced timeline display with real dates in stream detail modal

5. Initial Dashboard Setup (9768c04)

- Core UI: Added StreamBoost dashboard with theme toggle
- Layout Optimization: Implemented responsive design patterns

### 2.3 Back-end(smart contracts logic refactor)

## 3. Notices or best practice? limitation or should aware something?

Limitations

1. Back-end
   smart contracts.
   This project doesn't aim for building a comprehensive smart contracts, but for completing a relative comprehensive front-end by interacting with smart contracts. As you can see, there is only one smart contract, lacking different smart contract modules working together implmenting the core logic.
