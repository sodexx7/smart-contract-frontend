    enahnce smart contract basic logic

    1) add boost logic
    2) add penalities logic
    3) add cliffTime logic
    review: check the added documentation. increasing the reading tasks




    AI code problem
        delete boost logic. penalities logic
    cliff logic should show in the front-end

    fundamental business desgin: should have a clear mindset, seems AI's assumption also messy up.

       ```
        delete the boost and penalities logic in src/StreamBoost.sol, also the test cases in the test/StreamBoost.t.sol. \
        after modifying, should make the left test cases work.\
        deleted or modified the content in design-draft.md
